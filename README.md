# 24toCode-EnergyManagementToolkit 
Rockwell Automation 24toCode Hackathon **(1st Place)**

## Problem Description
For this Hackathon we wanted to focus on facility data analytics. Here at Rockwell, manufacturing is the heart of our industry -- it's of critical importance that we manufacture effectively. We've created a simple web app for easy user access (think something like energy.ra.rockwell.com), real-time data visualizations to allow for greater insight, and predictive Machine Learning models to try and mitigate the costs of Peak Demand Hours before they occur.
